The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

    static int index(int[] arr,int a){
        int in=0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
            if(a==arr[i]){
                in=i;
            }
        }return in;
    }

        int ret=-1;

            if(nums2[a]>n){
                ret=nums2[a];
                break;
            }a++;

        ArrayList<Integer> arr=new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i=0;i<nums1.length;i++){
            int a=index(nums2,nums1[i]);
            arr.add(next(nums2,nums1[i],a));
        }
        int[] arr1=new int[arr.size()];
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++){
            arr1[i]=arr.get(i);
        }return arr1;
